return $result;
```

The API uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register your API key
in the [Wallet](https://wallet.getadcoin.com), login/register open the menu on
the top right and select API key

The API expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`X-AUTH-TOKEN: myApiKey`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>myApiKey</code> with your personal API key.
